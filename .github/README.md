## üåä Abstract

The purpose of the project was to experiment with making my own LEGO game using official models from Mecabricks.com. By using community and self-built designs I was able to build small recreation of Plants vs Zombies.

It recreates core mechanics like seed selection, zombie waves, and tile-based combat. 16 plants are fully animated and useable as well as a decent codebase for adding new plants and abilities with most of the Plant and Zombie code being class based.

While this project is NOT a full game, there is a windows build. There is no win / lose state. If you would like to read more about how I made this project I have an article on the technical side of things as well as a YouTube video showing my process.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

This project was made using **Unity 6000 LTS** with the Universal Render Pipeline package installed. However any modern version of Unity and URP should work. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/TheDevAtlas/Lego-Plants-Vs-Zombies
   ```

2. **Open with Unity Hub**:
   - Launch Unity Hub
   - Click "Add" and navigate to the cloned repository folder
   - Select the project folder and open it with the appropriate Unity version

3. **Verify Required Assets**:
   - Universal Render Pipeline package
   - Unity Recorder package
   - Text Mesh Pro

## üå± Project Details

The current project includes:

- 16 Animated LEGO Plants
- 5 Zombie Types
- Dynamic Level Sizes
- Custom LEGO Culling for Improved Performance
- Full Gameplay Loop from Beginning to End:
- Select Plants
- Collect Sun
- Plant
- Fight

Future work with LEGO includes better rendering techniques and improving how I organize and write code. This was mostly an exercise in making a Plants vs Zombies clone; however, making a LEGO game is a technical challenge in itself, requiring creative shortcuts and optimizations for rendering.
